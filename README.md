I am Xor0v0, research on Pravacy Computing(Zero Knowledge Proof, ZKML etc.) and Verifiable Comoputing. BTW, I am really interesting in Web Penetration(HTB/THM player).

This is my github account and I will share some experience of projects and information security learning on it irregularly!

Hope you guys can make progress with me and make criticism and correction.Rng
